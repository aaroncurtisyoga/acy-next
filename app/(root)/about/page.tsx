        Wherever this message finds you, I hope you’re able to find a second to
        pause. Take a deep breath. And be present in a moment of gratitude.

        I’m constantly inspired by everything yoga has to teach. The philosophy,
        the physical movement, the meditation, and the breathwork. It’s my goal
        to take what I’ve learned in my own study of the practice, combined with
        modern research and science, and share it with you. So we can learn,
        practice, and grow together.
