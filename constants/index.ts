    question: "How often do you practice?",
    answer:
      "The majority of my yoga practice is breathwork and meditation. I feel my best when I do this daily. I also love taking Vinyasa classes in-person & online whenever I can. But these days a lot of my movement comes from CrossFit. I modify the workouts to prioritize building strength for arm balances & inversions.",
  },
  {
    question: "What level are your Vinyasa classes?",
    answer: `I really believe in teaching to the people in the room. So, if a class has a large amount of one level in the class, I’ll lean my class in that direction. Although, I always give options so everyone is included in the exploratory practice of Vinyasa.`,

    question: "Do you teach weekends?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Weekends are when I host events, workshops, and long form" +
