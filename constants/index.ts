    question: "How often do you practice?",
    answer:
      "Most days! Even if it’s for a couple minutes. The majority of my yoga practice is breathwork and meditation. Although I love public asana classes, and try to go whenever I can. I also do CrossFit and modify the workouts to prioritize increasing isometric strength for arm balances & inversions.\n",

  {
    question: "What level are your Vinyasa classes?",
    answer: `I really believe in teaching to the people in the room. So, if a class has a large amount of one level in the class, I’ll lean my class in that direction. Although, I always give options so everyone is included in the exploratory practice of Vinyasa.`,
