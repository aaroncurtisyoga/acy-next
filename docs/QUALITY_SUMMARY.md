# Code Quality Setup - Quick Reference

## 🎯 Problem Solved

- **Prevents linting errors from reaching main branch**
- **Catches TypeScript errors before deployment**
- **Ensures consistent code style across the team**
- **Prevents broken builds**

## 🛡️ Four-Layer Protection

### 1. Pre-commit Hook ⚡

- Runs **ESLint + Prettier** on changed files only
- **Auto-fixes** issues when possible
- **Fast** - only checks staged files

### 2. Pre-push Hook 🚀

- **Main branch**: Full lint + type check
- **Other branches**: Quick lint check
- **Prevents bad code from reaching remote**

### 3. GitHub Actions CI 🔒

- Runs on **all PRs and main branch pushes**
- **Complete validation**: lint + types
- **Required** to pass before merging (with branch protection)

### 4. Vercel Deployment 🚀

- **Build verification** with environment variables
- **Automatic deployment** on successful build
- **Rollback protection** if build fails

## 🚀 Quick Commands

```bash
# Check everything locally before pushing
npm run check          # lint + types
npm run check:fix       # lint + types with auto-fix
npm run validate        # lint + types + build (for local testing)

# Individual checks
npm run lint            # just linting
npm run lint:fix        # lint with auto-fix

# Note: Build validation is handled by Vercel deployment
```

## 📋 Current Status

✅ **CI Workflow**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Ready
✅ **Pre-commit Hook**: `.husky/pre-commit` - Active  
✅ **Pre-push Hook**: `.husky/pre-push` - Active
✅ **Lint-staged**: Configured in `package.json`
✅ **NPM Scripts**: Added convenience commands

## 🚨 Found Issues

The system already caught **22 TypeScript errors** that need to be fixed:

- `WizardLayout.tsx` - Missing properties
- `roles.ts` - Clerk auth issues
- Event form components - Type mismatches
- API webhook - Async/await issues

**Next step**: Run `npm run check:fix` and fix the remaining TypeScript errors.

## 🔄 Branch Protection (Recommended)

Enable in GitHub Settings → Branches:

- ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ✅ Select: `quality-checks` status check
- ✅ Include administrators

## 🎉 Benefits Achieved

- **No more broken builds** from linting errors
- **Consistent code style** across all contributors
- **Early error detection** - catch issues locally
- **Automated quality control** - no manual intervention needed
- **Fast feedback loop** - immediate notification of issues
